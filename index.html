    <h2>Lyrics to this song:</h2>
    <p>Look at me and watch me swim<br>
        In the sea of your thoughts<br>
        I think I like the way it's thin<br>
        I was so lost without you<br>
        But now I'm wondering are you lost too?<br><br>
        
        I was lost in the dream, but now I'm living in the real life<br>
        And your face make-believe<br>
        You're crying in the daylight<br><br>
        
        Happiness in life won't happen<br>
        I'm still floating but I sometimes wish that I could cry<br>
        And when I look I see anew<br>
        Into your soul and all the things I'd hold<br><br>
        
        I was lost in the dream, but now I'm living in the real life<br>
        And your face make-believe<br>
        You're crying in the daylight<br><br>
        
        I was lost in the dream, but now I'm living in the real life<br>
        And your face make-believe<br>
        You're crying in the daylight<br>
        I was lost in the dream, but now I'm living in the real life<br>
        And your face make-believe<br>
        You're crying in the daylight<br><br>
        
        I was lost in the dream, but now I'm living in the real life<br>
        Your face make-believe<br>
        You're crying in the daylight<br>
        I was lost in the dream, but now I'm living in the real life<br>
        Your face make-believe<br>
        You're crying in the daylight</p>
